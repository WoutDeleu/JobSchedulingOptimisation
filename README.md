### Job Scheduling Optimization with Local Search ðŸš€

Welcome to the Job Scheduling Optimization project, developed for the Optimization course at KU Leuven. In this project, we've applied local search algorithms to create an efficient job scheduling plan that adheres to specific constraints while maximizing productivity.

ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**
The central objective of this project is to optimize job scheduling for production. Each job corresponds to the manufacturing of a particular product, which may serve as an input for other products. The challenge is to create an efficient schedule that satisfies various constraints while aiming for maximum production output.

ðŸ“Š **Optimization Challenge**
The optimization challenge revolves around creating a schedule for various jobs while considering dependencies between products. The goal is to maximize production output, adhere to time and resource constraints, and minimize any bottlenecks in the manufacturing process.

ðŸš€ **Optimize Your Way to Success!**
The Job Scheduling Optimization project challenges you to apply local search algorithms to solve complex scheduling problems. Optimize your way to efficient job scheduling!
